# Node Farm Project ðŸ’¥

<br />

## Description ðŸ’¬

This project is a simple Node.js server that serves a product overview page, individual product detail pages, and a JSON API. The server uses the fs module to read HTML templates and data from JSON files. Products are displayed using dynamic templates, with slugs generated for each product using the slugify package. The project also includes basic routing, handling different paths for the overview page, product details, and the API endpoint.
